# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the analysis

This project analyzes weather data for a company which wants to set up a surf shop on an island in the Hawaii. Weather elements like precipitation and temperature trends are analyzed to provide information about good locations for the shop.

### Purpose

By analyzing the precipitation and temperature data and investigation active stations which report these data, we can identify whether certain locations are a good fit for setting up surf shops. This will enable the company to make informed decisions regarding their investments and plans.

## Results

After performing the analysis on the temperature trends in June and December for the island of Oahu, we can come to the following conclusions:

1. According to the June temperatures, as shown below:

![June_temps](https://github.com/Zarif601/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Resources/June_temps.PNG)

we can see that the average temperature in Oahu is about 75 degrees fahrenheit, which is a very comfortable temperature. We can also see that the the minimum temperature is 64 degrees while the maximum is 85 degrees, which shows that it never gets too hot or too cold in June at the island.

2. Analyzing the december temperatures, as follows:

![December_temps](https://github.com/Zarif601/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Resources/Dec_temps.PNG)

it is evident that even in the winter, at around 71 degrees fahrenheit, the average temperature doesn't fall too low. The minimum temperature drops to 53 degrees, however, the maximum temperature is still around the same as June, at 83 degrees.

3. Looking at the temperature trends from June and December, we can predict that the temperature remains consistent throughout the year and doesn't fluctuate much.

## Summary

From the analysis of the temperature trends we found that there is consistency in the weather at Oahu island. This is good because the company won't need to adjust too much with weather conditions to keep their shop running all year around. Similar analysis can be run for the precipitation data for June and December as well. Doing so would show us the precipitation patterns throughout the year at Oahu, and combined with the temperature analysis, could be very valuable information for the company to make decisions.
